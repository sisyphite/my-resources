# my-resources

This repository is a personal collection of internet resources.

## Purpose

- Replace browser bookmarks with a plain-text, version-controlled alternative
- Avoid loss, vendor lock-in, and opaque organization
- Keep only minimal structure and metadata

## How to use

- Add new resources to `bookmarks.md`
- Each entry should contain:
  - a URL
  - a short human-written note
- Use headings for coarse grouping
- Use free-form tags only if they help retrieval
